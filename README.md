## 📁 Files Overview

- **`run_analysis.R`**: Main script that:
  1. Merges training and test datasets.
  2. Extracts mean and standard deviation measurements.
  3. Assigns descriptive names to activities.
  4. Labels the dataset with descriptive variable names.
  5. Creates a tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and subject.

- **`CodeBook.md`**: Describes variables, dataset structure, and transformations performed.

- **`tidy_data.csv`**: Contains the final tidy dataset with averages for each variable.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. **Download the Data**: [Get the dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) and extract it to your working directory under a folder named DATA.

2. **Run the Script**: 
   - Open R or RStudio.
   - Run `run_analysis.R` to clean the data and generate `tidy_data.csv`.
